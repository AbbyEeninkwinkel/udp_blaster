This tool is suited for tuning and optimizing performance of log collectors.<br>
It simulates sending a supplied log message to a log collector.<br>
From a cozy 1 message per second to a flooding 100.000 messages per second if you system can handle that :)<br>
Currently it supports UPD only and runs native on Linux.<br>
